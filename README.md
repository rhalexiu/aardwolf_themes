# Rhalexiu's Themes
themes ive made in mushclient cause i was procrastinating

## Theme List
- **Polendina** -- green tech-y theme based on a certain robot
- **Lambda** -- crowbar theme, need i say more?

## Usage
1. Download ZIP of the theme repo.
2. Pick the theme you want to install, and copy the folders inside the theme folder to your MUSHclient installation.
  - Example: If I wanted to install the Polendina theme, I would copy the `lua` and `worlds` folders directly into
my MUSHclient installation.

3. Start MUSHclient, enter `aard theme change` and select your new theme!
